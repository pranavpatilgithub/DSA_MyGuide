# DSA – Structured Learning & Problem Solving in C++

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository. This is my personal log of understanding core DSA concepts, mastering problem-solving patterns, and tracking my growth as a software developer.

This repository includes:
- ✅ Well-documented **DSA concepts** with explanations and examples
- ✅ **Pattern-based problem solving** (like sliding window, two pointers, etc.)
- ✅ My **daily progress** and solved problems (categorized by topic & difficulty)
- ✅ C++ implementations with step-by-step logic
- ✅ Clean, structured folders for quick navigation and revision

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving mindset
- Crack coding rounds in interviews (FAANG-level and startups)
- Learn to break down problems and write clean, optimized code
- Build self-discipline through daily practice & documentation
